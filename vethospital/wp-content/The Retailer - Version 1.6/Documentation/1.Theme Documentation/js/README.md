=========================

A fixed table of contents drop-down menu jQuery plugin.

Just change the markup to add more depth to the menus. The script should automatically recognize deeper menus, as long as you have the corresponding sections in the content area.

If you want to go deeper than three levels, you'll have to add some extra CSS to indent the menus. Just look for the part with "li li li" and adjust accordingly.
