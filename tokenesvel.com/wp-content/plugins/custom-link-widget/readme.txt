Automatically Converts Inserted URLs and URL Names to Hyperlinks

== Description ==

Custom Link Widget Plugin is a Free WordPress plugin which allows you to add Hyperlinks directly using a Widget. This is quite similar to WordPress Link widget.

Whats the difference?

You don’t have to add links in LINKS section, instead of that you have to put the Link URL and Link Name in the widget, it will do the rest. Also, you will get an option to select the numbers of links to display.
