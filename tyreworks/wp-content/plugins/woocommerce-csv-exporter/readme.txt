Export woocommerce products

== Description ==
With this plugin you can export products with ease. Press export and all your published products are put in a CSV. It's compatible with the Woocommerce CSV Importer. Soo now you can make an example product like you want, export it, change it in the CSV and import it again. Or you export all products, change the stock or price and import it again. For now the following product types are supported:

* Variable products
* Simple products

In future releases all product types will be supported. 

The Woocomerce CSV exporter works great together with the Woocommerce CSV Import and the following add-ons:

1. Import variable products
2. Import attributes
3. Import custom fields
4. Import premium
